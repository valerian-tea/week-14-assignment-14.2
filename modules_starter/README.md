# unity-game-design-intro
A Unity project that helps users understand game design basics.


# Versioning
The project was created with Unity 2021.3.5f1, a Long Term Support version.

# Packages
The project replaces the default Unity Input class with the newer Input System package.

# Global settings
Uses the newer Input System package with the Update Mode set to Fixed Update.  This means that input processing should occur on a regular drumbeat in FixedUpdate() rather than in the frame-rate-dependent Update().
